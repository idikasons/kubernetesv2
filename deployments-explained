# This is a more used strategy in maintaining, upgrading and rolling back pods grecaefully.
It uses replica set to manage your pods.  it is used to update and upgrade pods in a controlled manner.
It deletes the old pods and recreate new one lets say you upgraded an Image.
It uses Deploymentment controller to make changes to pods.

## Sample below

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment 
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment           <<Name of your deployment
  labels: 
    app: nginx-deployment-label                     << Labels of your deployment

spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-pod-label                   <<< Label of your pod
  template:                                  << This is where the data of your container/pod is below
    matadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-pod-label                  <<pod label
    spec: 
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80


## Lets say after deployment I want to make a change to the container image I want to change (nginx:1.14.2 version to nginx:1.16.1) you can either change it in the manifest(best practice) Or run from the command terminal

(kubectl set image deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1

deployment.v1.apps = kind.apiVersion
nginx-deployment = name of deployment 
nginx = name of image not container name
nginx:1.16.1 = version


## Other commands
kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment-name>   # Check the rollout/deployment status
kubectl rollout pause deployment/<deployment-name>    # Pause an ongoing rollout
kubectl rollout resume deployment/<deployment-name>   # To resume a rollout
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name>     # To undo changes done on a deployment rollout eg. Roll your image back to old version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name> --to-revision=<revision-number>   # To undo changes done on a deployment rollout to a specific version
kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment-name>   # To view rollout history
