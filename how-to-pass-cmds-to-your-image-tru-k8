Remember in docker we use (CMD) to pass commands to out containers
eg.
FROM centos:7
CMD echo "This is a test," | wc -

# Note ENTRYPOINT has higher priority in a dockerfile than CMD. The commands in the ENTRYPOINT will run first

ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo 'Hello World' && sleep 10"]   << Then you can have CMD below it

# when used together ENTRYPOINT and CMD, ENTRYPOINT comes with the command and CMD the argument (when used together in a docker file)
eg.
(1)

FROM ubuntu
CMD ["echo hi"]

(2)

FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT["echo"]
CMD["hi"]



##### Now see an example of how you can mention command to run in the container level inside a pod in a manifest

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my_pod-cmd-demo
  labels:
    purpose: demo-command
spec:
  containers:
  - name: command-demo-container
    image: debian
    command: ["printenv"]
    args: ["HOSTNAME", "KUBERNETES_PORT"]
  restartPolicy: OnFailure
