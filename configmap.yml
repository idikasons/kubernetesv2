kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: managed-retain-sc

        #Based on the kubectl get sc (storage class). Note the retain in the name means (ReclaimPolicy)retain disk as part of Aks cluster
        # Note you can do managed-delete etc. Name must include sc as storage class flag.

provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-disk

        #Because we re using Azure disk to provision

reclaimPolicy: Retain

         #By default it is 'delete' but because we are doing a persistent storage, it has to be retain

volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer

       # By default it is immediate (kubectl get sc) , this means as soon as the persistent volume claim is created,
     #the persistent volume also gets created automatically, so we would change that, so that it only gets created when the pod workload is created/deployed.

allowVolumeExpansion: true   ##Allow auto expansion of disk when needed

parameters:
  storageAccountType: Standard_LRS   #you can use Standard_LRS, Premium_LRS
  kind: managed

# default is shared but we would use managed or dedicated
