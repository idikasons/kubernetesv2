In Kubernetes, Secrets are used to store and manage sensitive information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, SSH keys, and API keys. Unlike ConfigMaps, which store non-sensitive configuration data, Secrets help keep sensitive data secure and avoid exposing it in application code or configuration files.

## Use to make your password encoded, it can also be decoded (so not really secured)
example: echo -n "mypassword" | base64      << we re encoding using base64
Result/Output= bXlwYXNzd29yZA==   > This will be used to create your secret

Decode: ( echo 'bXlwYXNzd29yZA==' | base64 --decode)

The best way is always to store secrets in vaults or Sealed Secrets, HashiCorp Vault

You can also encrypt your data in kubernetes using encryption keys
